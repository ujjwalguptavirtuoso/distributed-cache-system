This is a low-level design code for a distributed cache system.

Code focuses on modularity, proper implementation of SOLID design principles and error handling.

This code can be used as a template to understand how cache systems like Redis and Memcached are implemented.

Right now, this code only has LRU(Least Recently Used) Eviction Policy, but it can be extended to other eviction policies too.
